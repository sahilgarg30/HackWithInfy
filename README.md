Problem Statement and Expectations

Manage a mobile and restrict the functionality

Design and Develop a Mobile Application and a Management Console (WebApp).  

Suggested features for the mobile App:
Â 
The App can scan QR Code, verify QR code and save details in DB
The App should be able to call few specified Telephone No, only which will be configured for each device through Management Console (Web Application)
The App should send the Telemetry data to the Management Console 
The App should be geo fenced. So, if the mobile phone on which it is installed, is moved by more than a particular distance (15 meters), it will raise alarm on the App and also raise concern at the Management console.
The App should be locked such that the users should not be able to open any App apart from this on the mobile phone it is installed. 
The person should not be allowed disable, GPS, WIFI, Mobile Data or switch off the device without password.
